is the process of evaluating the performance of an algorithm in terms of the input size. involves measuring how the running time or memory usage ofo a algorith scales with the size of the input data.

2 types:-
Time complexity:- refers to the amount ofo time taken by an algorithm to exucute 
space complexity :- refers to the amount of memory used by a algorithm to execute.
