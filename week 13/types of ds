Linear ds 

stores datat in a sequential ordr. allowing for easy inisertion and deletion operation.
eg: array, linked list,  queues

Non linear ds

storee data in hierarchical or interconnected manner allowing more complex relation between data element
eg :- trees, graphs and hash tables


linear ds:-
array :- collection of elements of same type stored in a contigous memory location 
linked list:- collection of elements linked together by pointers, allowing for dynamic insertion and deletion
queue :- (fifo)stuture where elements are added at the end and removed from theh begining
stack :- (lifo)stuture where elements are added and removed from the from the top


non_linear
tree :- 
graph
hash table
